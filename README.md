# Tic Tac Toe Learner
An AI that learns how to play tic tac toe using a simple machine learning algorithm.

### How it works
The AI stores every move that has been made and the move's value in a text file. For every turn, the AI
makes a decision by looking at all the next possible moves and choosing the one with the highest value. 
When the game ends, if the AI wins, the values of all the moves that have been made will be incremented, and
similarly, if the AI loses, the values of all the moves that have been made will be decremented.

### Required External Packages

## Update:

**Thank You to All Who Participated!**

It took around **188 games** against humans to make the AI virtually **unbeatable**. It would usually take around 10,000 games against another AI trainer for the AI to get sub-par. The memories are now updated in realtime ;).
